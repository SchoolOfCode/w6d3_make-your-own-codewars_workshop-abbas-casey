    Input is an array of numbers and strings.
    The function should return an array with two nested arrays: one of only the numbers, and one of only the strings.
    ['a', 1, 'b', 2] => [['a', 'b'], [1,2]]

    If there is any string that isn't completely letters or numbers (including any whitespace!) then throw this error: "this aint it chief"
